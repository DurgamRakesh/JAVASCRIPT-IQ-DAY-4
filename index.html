    <h1>JAVASCRIPT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS PREPARATION DAY-4</h1>

    <p>21.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript?</p>
    <pre>
        Local Scope:- Any variable that can be declare inside a function is said to be a Local Scope.

        EX:
        function myfun(){
            var a = 10; ---> Local Scope
            console.log(a);
        }

        Block Scope:- Any variable that can be declare inside a block {} , can be accessed only
        inside block, cannot access outside of block.
        -Block Scope works with only let and const keywords , not with var keyword.

        EX:
        {
            let a = 10; ---> Block Scope
            console.log(a);
        }

        Function Scope: Any variable that can be declare inside of funtion only access in that
        function it cannot access outside of function.

        EX:
        function foo(){
            var a = 10; ---> Function Scope
            console.log(a)
        }

        Scope Chain: Javascript engine also uses Scope Chain to find variables where it is avilable.

        EX:
        function f1(){
            var a = 10;
            function f2(){
                var b = 20;
                console.log(a+b);
            }
            return f2();
        }
        f2();
    </pre>
    <p>22.What is difference between null and undefined?</p>
    <pre>
        undefined: a variable is declared but no value has been assigned to that variable.
        -typeof undefined is undefined.
        -undefined is a primitive value used when a variable has been assigned a value.
        -It indicates absence of variable itselt.

        EX:
        console.log(a); ---> it will give undefined
        var a ;

        Null: Null is a assignment value, you can assign it to a variable.
        -typeof null is object.
        -It is primitive value that represants null, empty, non-exists reference.
        -It indicates the absence of a value for a variable.

        EX:
        var a = null;
        console.log(a); ----> it will give null
    </pre>
    <p>23.What is an event loop and call stack?</p>
    <pre>
        callstack: A callstack is a way for the javascript engine to keep track of its place
        in code that calls multiples functions.
        -It has information about what functions are currently being run and
        what functions are invoked with in that function.
        -callstack works based on LIFO (Last-In-First-Out).

        event loop: The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both
        the callback queue and the callstack.
        -All web APIs functions like setTimeout,setInterval,fetch will not executed directly
        inside execution context.
        -firstly functions are moved to callback queue and then moment callstack gets empty 
        these functions will be pused to callstack from callback queue by event loop.
        -if callstack not empty , event loop wait until is is empty and place the next function from
        the callback queue to callstack.if callback queue is empty, nothing will happen.
    </pre>
    <p>24.What are promises and why do we need them?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, Promise is a special javascript object .it produces a value after an
        asynchronous operation completes sucessfully or if not completed sucessfully
        it will give error.
        -sucessfully operations are indicate by resolve function call, where as errors
        are indicate by reject function call.
        -promises are used to handle the asynchronous operations in javascript.
        they are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations 
        where callback are creat callback hell leading to unmanagble code.

        A promise is in one of these states:
        pending: initial state, either fulfilled or rejected.
        fulfilled: operations was completed sucessfully.
        reject: operations are faild.

        Benfits of promises:
        -code readability.
        -better for handle asynchronous operations.
        -error handling and etc.

        EX:
        let p = new Promise((res,rej) => {
            let a = true;
            if(a){
                res('hello this is resolve state')
            }
            else{
                rej('hello this is reject state')
            }
        });
        
        p.then((x) => {
            console.log(x);
        })
        .catch((y) => {
            console.log(y);
        })
    </pre>
    <p>25.What is promise chaining?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, The process of executing a sequnce of asynchronous tasks 
        one after using promise is known as promise chaining.
        
        EX:
        let promisechaing = new Promise((res,rej) => {
            setTimeout(()=>{
               res(10);
            },1000);
        
        });
        
        promisechaing.then((a)=>{
            console.log(a);   --->10
            return a*2
        })
        .then((b)=>{
            console.log(b);   --->20
            return b*3
        })
        .then((c)=>{
            console.log(c);   --->60
            return c*4
        })
        .then((d)=>{
            console.log(d);   --->240
            return d*5
        })
        .then((e)=>{
            console.log(e);   --->1200
        })
    </pre>
    <p>26.What are pure functions?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, A pure functions is a function that always return the
        same result if the same arguments are passed it is called as 
        pure functions.
        -pure functions does not have any side-effects.
        -An inmpure functions is function that contains one or more side-effects

        Pure Function EX:
        function add(a,b){
            return a*b
        }
        console.log(add(5,6));

        Impure Function EX:
        var x = 10;
        function sum(a,b){
            x = 10;
            return a+b+x
        }
        console.log(sum(5,6));
